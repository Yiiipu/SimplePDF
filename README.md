# SimplePDF
Simple MacOS PDF reader with ChatGPT integrated. You can chat with your local PDF. The returned response can cite the page number to ensure correctness.

## How it works
SimplePDF uses Apple's PDFKit to deal with PDF rendering and open-source [pdfGPT](https://github.com/bhaskatripathi/pdfGPT) to deal with PDF chatting. As a result, it has fast and beautiful rendering, and the response of GPT model can cite the page number to ensure the information you get is correct. Another bonus is you do not need to upload any PDF to those "chatPDF" sites to start chatting. Simply click-open your local files using SimplePDF and everything is there for you.
